## GeoPlot

A simple ploting tool with a worldmap, rulers and title using **QGraphicsView** and **QGraphicsSene** from **Qt** You could even export the viewport as SVG(testing) and PNG.

## Motivation

I was tired of using big bloated vizualizer tools, they are really nice but I just need something 
simple to plot wind trajectories.

## Installation

Just clone and open with **QtCreator**, have fun!

## Contributors

Feel free to use it in your projects, this is a relative new project and I am still learning Qt and C++.
